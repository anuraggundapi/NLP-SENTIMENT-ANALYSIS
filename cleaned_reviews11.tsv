Then I discovered all the other things Alexa can do. Play music you ask for. Great sound from Alexa. Play games. Play radio stations. Play old time radio programs like the Long Ranger. Alexa has many “apps” you can add to her abilities. The other day I played Madlibs. Great fun. Also Alexa can control household appliances. I just purchased Alexa compatible power strips to control lighting, fans and TV components. I’m looking forward to implementing this controll. You can also add other Alexa components to have chosen music to play in all rooms where the components are located.	1	bought control fio televis work well im hope time control fio discov thing alexa play music ask great sound alexa play game play radio station play old time radio program like long ranger alexa mani app add abil day play madlib great fun also alexa control household applianc purchas alexa compat power strip control light fan tv compon im look forward implement control also add alexa compon chosen music play room compon locat	0.29375	73	1	2	False	True	-0.9689541864873362	4.877342412840282

You can also connect your iPhone with bluetooth and play music with Pandora or YouTube videos using Alexa as a speaker. I've been having fun asking Alexa different types of questions or for information like weather, news or even the time in other countries. The only downside is if you have limited data on your wifi plan, because Alexa uses burns it up when playing music.	1	love think get one prime day discount offer could pass fun ask alexa play song group come playlist amazon prime music also connect iphon bluetooth play music pandora youtub video use alexa speaker ive fun ask alexa differ type question inform like weather news even time countri downsid limit data wifi plan alexa use burn play music	0.3666666666666667	57	1	2	False	True	-0.021431096404970353	3.6911141637853944

My only two ( not complaints, more suggestions for the future series) would be better communication ability. Example: For our smart lights in the house.

I have 6 now (and one google clone) and the more I use it, and learn about it, the more I like it (them). I also plan to install one in my car, boat and garage. Alexa is my new best friend!?!?

I believe the ring is supposed to be yellow and pulsate for a message notification, but on my refurbished Echo Dot it was Green and pulsed.	1	far certifi refurbish echo dot work well littl confus green ring echo dot know ask alexa said receiv call drop case took minut figur notif deliveri amazon believ ring suppos yellow pulsat messag notif refurbish echo dot green puls	-0.07500000000000001	39	1	0	False	False	-0.318844323373792	2.046130556400814

Alexa has many “apps” you can add to her abilities. The other day I played Madlibs. Great fun. Also Alexa can control household appliances. I just purchased Alexa compatible power strips to control lighting, fans and TV components. I’m looking forward to implementing this controll.

But if you are going to do that why wouldn't you just get a dot?  2nd issue is (which isn't unique to this unit but I don't understand why I can't override the default that prevents you from playing a blue tooth speaker while playing through a &#34;group&#34;.  I get there is a delay when using a BT speaker.  But if the other units are not where they can be heard then I should be able to play as a group while using the BT speaker.	1	dont think nd gen sound good st aux could add extern speaker go wouldnt get dot nd issu isnt uniqu unit dont understand cant overrid default prevent play blue tooth speaker play group get delay use bt speaker unit heard abl play group use bt speaker	0.3666666666666667	46	1	2	False	True	-1.1902312773030395	2.727039781855529

Unless we specify kitchen Light 1 or kitchen Light 2 prior to the command she either won’t respond or says she doesn’t recognize. It may be me, but I want my Alexa to respond when I say thank you afterwards. I have to repeat Alexa thank you and there are times she won’t respond to me, but will my husband. I know it sounds odd. We laugh about it, but maybe it’s a Southern thing but I want my Alexa to have manners too.	1	love new addit hous speaker qualiti great love alexa two complaint suggest futur seri would better commun abil exampl smart light hous unless specifi kitchen light kitchen light prior command either wont respond say doesnt recogn may want alexa respond say thank afterward repeat alexa thank time wont respond husband know sound odd laugh mayb southern thing want alexa manner	0.2722655122655123	60	1	2	False	True	-0.8278407567866785	3.836236144562806

The potential to control your home is an option I will explore more as I evolve my home into a ""smart home"". The voice recognition is very impressive. It is stylish and fun. I have no regrets with this purchase. It is great for technically changes people. Ask it to play a song or a movie and it responds instantly. If you have an elderly loved one, this would be a great gift. Once connected to wifi, it is very simple to use.  If you want unlimited music control, be sure to have amazon prime or premium spotify and you will be blown away with your personal dj! You can even have conversations with the echo.

I wasconcerned about having both devices answering at the same time when I discoveredthat I had other name choices (not enough for me but just enough to avoid confusion).I named him “Echo.” Now if I could only choose a male voice.

4	30-Jul-18	Black  Spot	It's not perfect, but I really like this little gizmo. i bought it primarily for 2 purposes. First, so I could set wake-up alarms by individual days, and set the wake-up music individually by the day. Second, I wanted to control a bedroom light by voice, so I could shut it off as I was falling asleep, without having to get out of bed to turn a switch. The Echo Spot, together with a smart plug,has been able to accomplish that. A bonus has been getting Alexa to play music from my Amazon Prime playlists.What's not so great is that sometimes Alexa has a really hard time understanding instructions, and repeating and altering the way you say things can get pretty frustrating. Hopefully the AI gets better in the future, along with added functions.	1	perfect realli like littl gizmo bought primarili purpos first could set wakeup alarm individu day set wakeup music individu day second want control bedroom light voic could shut fall asleep without get bed turn switch echo spot togeth smart plugha abl accomplish bonu get alexa play music amazon prime playlistswhat great sometim alexa realli hard time understand instruct repeat alter way say thing get pretti frustrat hope ai get better futur along ad function	0.35907738095238095	74	1	2	False	True	-0.9036315173587041	4.9888772468646785

Furthermore, you can do some basic navigation using the touch screen as well as tailor the settings.

If you are looking to get an alarm clock, this is the one to get (yes, its much more than that).  It shows you the time, it shows you the weather, its touch screen, it shows you music lyrics, and it does all the things your typical alexa device does.  It's quite loud for its size as well (sound way better than echo dot).  It also does video calling, which is pretty awesome.  The viewing angle is great, so even if its sitting fairly high up, you can still see the display well enough.	1	dont know like like allinon alarm clock alexa devic know look get alarm clock one get ye much show time show weather touch screen show music lyric thing typic alexa devic quit loud size well sound way better echo dot also video call pretti awesom view angl great even sit fairli high still see display well enough	0.30125	57	1	2	False	True	-0.09969262086900474	3.6588040622730333

Only issue is the volume of alexa speaking when you tell her to turn off the lights is loud when the volume is set to what you want to listen to the music at night	1	im fan echo devic think great altern clean clock like use adjust lightn room listen sound help sleep two year old sleep much better also use tell two year old stori issu volum alexa speak tell turn light loud volum set want listen music night	0.3458333333333334	45	1	2	False	True	-0.547346992438618	2.6835397246686843

I'm using to listen to free music with prime (better than alternatives), audible and you can even watch movies. The display is a little small for lots of watching, the sound should be louder, and YOUTUBE NEEDS TO BE AVAILABLE. These issues put this at a 3.5 to 4 stars. Fix one of them (youtube) and its a 5 star item. To alleviate sound I've paired with a blue tooth speaker. Right now this sits in my living area. Where I think it will shine is my office desk. Once there are great offers I could see purchasing additional for nightstand or other Amazon Alexa items for my household. I felt happy after adding this to my house where as I felt stupid using google home.	1	love way googl home devic ive use coupl month your amazon prime subscrib valu greater googl im use listen free music prime better altern audibl even watch movi display littl small lot watch sound louder youtub need avail issu put star fix one youtub star item allevi sound ive pair blue tooth speaker right sit live area think shine offic desk great offer could see purchas addit nightstand amazon alexa item household felt happi ad hous felt stupid use googl home	0.2393398268398268	81	1	2	False	True	-1.1367043465050422	5.484619209382337

My biggest gripe about the device and why I knocked a star off is that you can't turn off the suggestions on &#34;Things to Try&#34;. It 's an annoying and a stupid design decision since you have control to turn off other things you don't want to see as it cycles through content screens.

Sometimes I'm not being heard on the other spot and vice versa.  The voices tends break up or the sound coming through is intermittent. The optical is fine........ it's just the sound. Sometimes I'll have to repeat the wake word 2-3 times and I'm only 8 feet away plus it's on one of those $20 stands.  I find the ECHO DOT, Original echo and the Show has much better sound quality.  That's one reason I bought the Echo Show.	1	star origin tall echo dot spot show thing im find problem speaker spot use drop sometim im heard spot vice versa voic tend break sound come intermitt optic fine sound sometim ill repeat wake word time im feet away plu one stand find echo dot origin echo show much better sound qualiti that one reason bought echo show	0.26944444444444443	58	1	2	False	True	-0.8055516780728509	3.676305120578382

But the screen is always on unless you tell it to turn it off - instead of just a talking cylinder you now have a mini screen that not only talks to you but also writes out everything it says or shows accompanying video.  There is something about only audio that made Alexa different, no I some ways it is a TV that you can talk to.	1	two week sure like ever present alexa screen well bought abay monitor combin wifi camera work screen alway unless tell turn instead talk cylind mini screen talk also write everyth say show accompani video someth audio made alexa differ way tv talk	0.25	42	1	2	False	True	-1.2784778187424053	2.352341343551423

We also use it for maintaining lists, as a music player, general information, and entertainment.

Bought the Google Home and the Home Mini... has trouble from the start setting them up, and they couldn’t understand my husband (Scottish accent). After days of the “oops, something went wrong” command.. we returned them and bought the Amazon Echo Show and the Echo Plus... so easy to set up! It connected immediately to my amazon account and was way easier to navigate. They both understand commands from my husband on the first try and have yet to give an error message.

5	25-Jul-18	White  Plus	I have been hesitant to purchase anything smart home because I am just not good with electronics.  However this surprised me how easy it is to set up and it links to the Bluetooth in my sound bar for my TV which provides extra sound for music, I can make calls and finally hear people when home. I do not have cable, only the paid apps like Netflix and Hulu so when Alexa provided me news stations, weather and other updates it was really great to hear! I have linked all of my accounts to her, she turns on my lights before I walk through the door. She purchases re-orders off of Amazon for my pets and I heard if something bad happened at your home she would place a call to 911 regardless if she was unplugged or not.  This is important as an extra layer of protection for someone living alone.  My tech savvy bf went out and bought her after a week of me having her.

It doesn’t work with z wave (as it states), it doesn’t take voice commands for SmartThings, which I had to buy since the hub doesn’t work for z wave.It also sounds muffled and there is no way to control the EQ. (Not sure if that is on all models, but the Dots we have are clear.For the money, buy an echo dot or echo (2nd generation).  The echo dot takes voice commands for the smart things hub, go figure, and the audio is clear. The dot also seems to hear my voice better and almost at a whisper.	1	pro plenti loud larg room high ceilingscon hub doesnt anyth doesnt work z wave state doesnt take voic command smartth buy sinc hub doesnt work z waveit also sound muffl way control eq sure model dot clearfor money buy echo dot echo nd gener echo dot take voic command smart thing hub go figur audio clear dot also seem hear voic better almost whisper	0.2820408163265306	64	1	2	False	True	-1.5224504787922988	4.112080999690774
3	16-Jul-18	White  Plus	Alexa is a decent speaker if that's all you need. She is terrible at most other things. She consistently answers questions that were not asked or says &#34;hmmm I don't know that&#34; for everything else. We've gone back to just using our phones because she can't really look anything up. Pretty much everyone makes fun of me for spending money on this when I had an awesome Bose bluetooth already. I bought her because my mother (who lives alone) uses hers a lot and is happy with it, but we have a full house with kids and I'm less than impressed. I'd never recommend it to anyone except for senior citizens who love alone and need to be able to shout out for help in the event of a fall.	1	alexa decent speaker that need terribl thing consist answer question ask say hmmm dont know everyth els weve gone back use phone cant realli look anyth pretti much everyon make fun spend money awesom bose bluetooth alreadi bought mother live alon use lot happi full hous kid im less impress id never recommend anyon except senior citizen love alon need abl shout help event fall	0.18579545454545454	65	1	2	False	True	-1.650426089788338	4.14381305583978

Basic functionality works with this unit, but now I need two apps to set everything how I want it instead of one, which has caused some user issues. It's woken up a couple times without the trigger word, which I find highly unsettling. We have minor issues with it not always picking up what we say correctly, but it's usually just one or two repeats if that happens.The speaker is great quality and easily covers the kitchen/living room. The sleek design is not obtrusive.

Basically ignoring you. Often she is unable to answer basic questions.It’s been so frustrating. Alexa has been more work rather than making my life easier.I would return it but I’m past the return period...... zzzz	0	got month ago idea help control smart bulb use answer question get daili weather updatesit far usefulhalf time wake devic ask question initi command doesnt hear say turn basic ignor often unabl answer basic questionsit frustrat alexa work rather make life easieri would return im past return period zzzz	0.012857142857142855	49	0	2	False	True	-5.504308689621619	2.218395908742331

A little tricky to connect to wifi initially, but after some trial and error it connected, and has stayed connected. So far, super satisfied.

The set up was easy and straight forward which I really appreciated because I am terrible with technology. The only reason why I am not satisfied with my purchase is because of the fact that I can't use the Echo Dot for more than 15 minutes without it disconnecting from the internet. I am connected to both 2.4GHZ and 5GHZ wifi links and neither works. It's very frustrating because I am not getting my use out of the Echo Dot and I really wish I could.

4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I had some trouble with my echo dot when I first got it because of internet connection issues. After doing research online I saw from some other people that they had trouble with the 2nd generation Echo Dot. However, the same weekend I took a trip and brought my Echo Dot along to the hotel where it seemed to work just fine. Now back home, the internet connection has seemed to have gotten through it's little rough patch and I haven't had any problems since. So, if you are having connection issues with an Echo Dot then it is probably the internet and not the device.	1	troubl echo dot first got internet connect issu research onlin saw peopl troubl nd gener echo dot howev weekend took trip brought echo dot along hotel seem work fine back home internet connect seem gotten littl rough patch havent problem sinc connect issu echo dot probabl internet devic	0.1416666666666667	48	1	2	False	True	-0.8300988196382278	2.8205057759531176

So yes I love my echo stuff but, I did create a isolated VLAN on my home network to run the devices including the cheap ones that require you to sign up on some questionable website and download their app. Be carful with these people!  Entering your Wi-Fi password on a site that’s not vetted and your location when the app askes is not a good thing. Try to stay with devices that  work directly with the Alexa hub with no third-party app, Amazon has more control of these types of devices and how the  sensitive information is handled.	1	say well im paranoid person year got hook idea cloud base home control ye love echo stuff creat isol vlan home network run devic includ cheap one requir sign question websit download app car peopl enter wifi password site that vet locat app ask good thing tri stay devic work directli alexa hub thirdparti app amazon control type devic sensit inform handl	0.19999999999999998	62	1	2	False	True	-0.28498370526197836	4.0051395929759055

It works great with the Alexa App. I also think the size is great for college students who live in dorm rooms with small limited spacing.	1	echo dot nd gener smart speaker compound size howev project good sound also port connect extern speaker greater project sound also like size awkward doesnt take lot space work great alexa app also think size great colleg student live dorm room small limit space	0.31006493506493504	44	1	2	False	True	-0.5773066392010671	2.586604438126401

I mean, it's convenient, especially for those unable to reach to turn off lights or electronics that you could hook up to the Dot.

I know Amazon probably wanted to keep costs down for this item but I really like to play music around the apartment when I am busy doing things so if they would have added a speaker with just a little more wattage and bass response they would have something great to put in the bathroom or kitchen where there might not be a lot of space for a full sized Echo. I would have been willing to pay 10 to 20 dollars more if it had a better speaker. Oh well it is what it is and I still love it.

The set up was easy and straight forward which I really appreciated because I am terrible with technology. The only reason why I am not satisfied with my purchase is because of the fact that I can't use the Echo Dot for more than 15 minutes without it disconnecting from the internet. I am connected to both 2.4GHZ and 5GHZ wifi links and neither works. It's very frustrating because I am not getting my use out of the Echo Dot and I really wish I could.

4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I had some trouble with my echo dot when I first got it because of internet connection issues. After doing research online I saw from some other people that they had trouble with the 2nd generation Echo Dot. However, the same weekend I took a trip and brought my Echo Dot along to the hotel where it seemed to work just fine. Now back home, the internet connection has seemed to have gotten through it's little rough patch and I haven't had any problems since. So, if you are having connection issues with an Echo Dot then it is probably the internet and not the device.	1	troubl echo dot first got internet connect issu research onlin saw peopl troubl nd gener echo dot howev weekend took trip brought echo dot along hotel seem work fine back home internet connect seem gotten littl rough patch havent problem sinc connect issu echo dot probabl internet devic	0.1416666666666667	48	1	2	False	True	-0.8300988196382278	2.8205057759531176

So yes I love my echo stuff but, I did create a isolated VLAN on my home network to run the devices including the cheap ones that require you to sign up on some questionable website and download their app. Be carful with these people!  Entering your Wi-Fi password on a site that’s not vetted and your location when the app askes is not a good thing. Try to stay with devices that  work directly with the Alexa hub with no third-party app, Amazon has more control of these types of devices and how the  sensitive information is handled.	1	say well im paranoid person year got hook idea cloud base home control ye love echo stuff creat isol vlan home network run devic includ cheap one requir sign question websit download app car peopl enter wifi password site that vet locat app ask good thing tri stay devic work directli alexa hub thirdparti app amazon control type devic sensit inform handl	0.19999999999999998	62	1	2	False	True	-0.28498370526197836	4.0051395929759055

And the dots don’t pick up voice as good as my tall echo.Still totally love them and would recommend 100%	1	realli love dot awesom connect room like youv read review definit lower volum im sure connect speaker anoth devic would great stand alon volum ok definit like tall echo dot dont pick voic good tall echostil total love would recommend	0.5	40	1	2	False	True	-0.2987488150078586	2.363340390730588

It also has a port in which you can connect an external speaker  for greater projection of sound. I also like it size because it's not awkward, and it doesn't take up a lot of space. It works great with the Alexa App. I also think the size is great for college students who live in dorm rooms with small limited spacing.	1	echo dot nd gener smart speaker compound size howev project good sound also port connect extern speaker greater project sound also like size awkward doesnt take lot space work great alexa app also think size great colleg student live dorm room small limit space	0.31006493506493504	44	1	2	False	True	-0.5773066392010671	2.586604438126401

I would have been willing to pay 10 to 20 dollars more if it had a better speaker. Oh well it is what it is and I still love it.
