# NLP-SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS
## üìå Project Overview

This project focuses on *Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP)* techniques to analyze customer reviews collected from Amazon. Sentiment Analysis, a subfield of NLP, involves classifying text into subjective categories such as positive, negative, or neutral. It has become a critical tool for businesses to understand customer feedback, product perception, and overall satisfaction.

In this project, we preprocess raw textual data, explore linguistic patterns, and apply various machine learning algorithms to accurately predict the sentiment of a review. The final model is deployed using *Streamlit*, allowing users to interact with the application by entering custom reviews for real-time sentiment prediction.

1. *Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* to understand sentiment distribution and word-level insights.
2. *Preprocess the Text Data* including cleaning, tokenization, lemmatization, and vectorization.
3. *Feature Engineering* with techniques like TF-IDF, and selection of impactful features.
4. *Build and Compare Machine Learning Models*:

   * Logistic Regression
   * Naive Bayes
   * Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   * Decision Tree
